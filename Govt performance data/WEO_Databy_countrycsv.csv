Argentina,"Inflation, average consumer prices",Index,,"Source: National Statistics Office Latest actual data: 2021 Notes: The official national consumer price index (CPI) for Argentina starts in December 2016. For earlier periods, CPI data for Argentina reflect the Greater Buenos Aires Area CPI (prior to December 2013), the national CPI (IPCNu, December 2013 to October 2015), the City of Buenos Aires CPI (November 2015 to April 2016), and the Greater Buenos Aires Area CPI (May 2016 to December 2016). Given limited comparability of these series on account of differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the average CPI inflation for 2014-16 and end-of-period inflation for 2015-16 are not reported in the World Economic Outlook. Inflation projections reflect the upper bound of the program range given recent world commodity price developments. Harmonized prices: No Base year: FY2013/14.

New weights , a new product basket, an expanded price collection were introduced based on 2018/2019 Household Budget Survey for the CPI starting in Jan.2021.The index reference period for the new CPI index series is therefore 2020=100. Starting with theindex for January 2021, only the new CPI index series will be calculated.To enable a long run CPI index series to be published. The new CPI index (2020=100) must belinked to the current CPI index series (2014=100), this requires the new index series to be rescaledto the level of the last monthly index of the current CPI index series i.e., December 2020. Startingwith the index for January 2021, this is achieved by multiplying each month's index of the newupdated CPI series by the December 2020 index of the current CPI index series 2014, then dividingby 100. The actual calculation of the  All items' index for January 2021 linked to the current CPIindex is given below by way of example.103.84 (All Items index Jan 2021) * 116.41(All items index Dec 2020)/100=120.88 Primary domestic currency: Seychelles rupee Data last updated: 04/2022",105.928,109.85,111.835,113.18,124.238,131.135,2020
