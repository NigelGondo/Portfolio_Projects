    "The purpose of conducting this project is to ascertain if good governance and ease of doing business in a country have a relationship with the amount of investment it receives. I choose three countries, which are New Zealand, South Africa and Eritrea. The reason I choose these three countries is that for governance and ease of doing business, New Zealand ranks on the upper spectrum, South Africa is in the middle and Eritrea is on the lower end of these rankings, so with this, I thought it would provide a more realistic picture if there is a relationship with investment. \n",
